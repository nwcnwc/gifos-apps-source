/* simplefin.js — the one aggregator that fits a computer with no server.
 *
 * SimpleFIN exists because Mint died. The user sets up a connection at a
 * SimpleFIN server (the Bridge is the usual one), is handed a one-time SETUP
 * TOKEN, and claims it ONCE for an ACCESS URL that returns every account they
 * connected. That is the whole protocol, and it is the only reason this app
 * can pull balances at all: Plaid, Teller and MX all need a server-side secret
 * and GifOS has nowhere to keep one.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ABOUT THE ACCESS URL, both of which have bitten:
 *
 *   It carries the credential INSIDE the URL — https://<user>:<pass>@host/… —
 *   and a browser fetch REJECTS such a URL outright, with a TypeError, before
 *   any request is made. It has to be split and re-sent as an Authorization:
 *   Basic header. GifOS Settings does that splitting when the entry is saved
 *   (desktop.js splitCreds), which is why this file never sees the URL and
 *   never sees the credential: it calls gifos.api('simplefin', …), the runtime
 *   attaches it, and pins the request to that host.
 *
 *   The host is different for every user, and self-hosted servers are a normal
 *   thing to run. That is exactly why this goes through gifos.api (a
 *   user-configured base URL) and not capabilities.network, whose allow-list is
 *   fixed in the manifest and could never name it.
 *
 * The response has been through a version change and both shapes are live in
 * the wild: the older one puts an `org` on every account and errors in
 * `errors`; the newer one hoists organisations into `connections` and renames
 * the error list `errlist`. Reading only one of them means a user on the other
 * server gets an app that says they have no accounts. Both are read.
