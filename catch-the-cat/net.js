/*
 * Catch the Cat — netplay.
 *
 * The room comes from the OS Invite button; this app never draws one. Each
 * player owns exactly one row in gifos.db('players') and only ever writes that
 * row. There is no referee: every client scores the round off the same rows,
 * so two screens cannot disagree unless they saw different rows, and a guest
 * who lied about their row would only be cheating themselves.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES OF ROUND, both carried on the same rows, both self-scored.
 *
 *   RACE — everyone gets the same seed, plays their own private copy, and the
 *   fewest taps to pen the cat takes the round. The row says how your board is
 *   going (clicks / status) and carries your running series tally.
 *
 *   CO-OP — one board, one cat each, no turns. The row additionally carries the
 *   walls YOU placed (so every client can union them into the shared board) and
 *   where YOUR cat is (so every client can draw it without simulating it). The
 *   room clears the round when every live cat is walled in, and loses it the
 *   moment ANY cat reaches the rim — which is why the co-op verdict does not
 *   wait for the field to finish the way the race verdict does. An escape is
 *   already the answer.
 *
 * The mode lives on the ROUND, not on the player, so a room cannot be half in
 * one game and half in the other: starting a round is what chooses.
 *
 * The collection is the host's stored state, not a presence list: a player who
 * closes the app leaves their row behind forever. So rows carry a heartbeat,
 * and a player who has gone quiet for STALE_MS drops out of the roster and
 * stops holding up the round. Staleness is measured on the LOCAL clock (when
 * we last saw the stamp change), never by comparing their clock to ours.
