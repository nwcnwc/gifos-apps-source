# Flexbox Froggy

An unofficial port of **[Flexbox Froggy](https://github.com/thomaspark/flexboxfroggy)**
(Thomas Park, MIT; frog and lilypad art CC BY 3.0). Write CSS flexbox to hop
frogs onto lilypads. Twenty-four levels. Progress lives in the file. Send the
invite and a friend lands in the same pond — you share the CSS, the frogs hop
on both screens.

```

jQuery, animate.css, ads, and analytics are not shipped. The title face
is **Fredoka One** (OFL, vendored as woff2) — no Google Fonts CDN.
Fifty locale strings were dropped (they were 640 KB); the puzzles are
the English originals.
