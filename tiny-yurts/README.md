# Tiny Yurts

An unofficial port of **[Tiny Yurts](https://github.com/burntcustard/tiny-yurts)**
by burntcustard (MIT). js13k 2023, 4th place. Path-drawing between yurts and
farms. Best score in the file.

Upstream is Vite ESM + kontra. The jam `dist/index.html` is a Roadroller
`eval` blob, which the sandbox will not run. `vendor/game.js` is an esbuild
IIFE of `src/main.js`, with a small phone-drag patch (touch counts as a
left-drag, pointer capture). `shim.js` stubs `localStorage`. `boot.js`
hydrates `gifos.db` into the stub and paints the highscore, then fits the
valley on a portrait phone.

```
index.html      shim, game, boot (game is a static script so the packer inlines it)
style.css       full-bleed, touch-action none
boot.js         save + roster + portrait fit + Back
icon.mjs        yurt + path + 1200×720 cover
build.mjs       packs site/apps/tiny-yurts/tiny-yurts.gif
vendor/         IIFE, MIT notices
```

## Building

## Licence

John's MIT notice and kontra's MIT notice are packed inside the GIF.
