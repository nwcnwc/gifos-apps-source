# InvaderZ

Space invaders, except the invaders change shape as you play. Solo it is
Victor Ribeiro's InvaderZ. Send the invite and extra cannons appear on the
same ground. On a phone the buttons sit under the board, not on the cannon.

The engine is **[InvaderZ](https://github.com/victorqribeiro/invaderz)** by
victorqribeiro — MIT. This directory is the GifOS port: a classic-script
shell around it, thumb buttons, and the extra cannons. Upstream has no
networking.

## Why this can run as a GifOS app

Upstream is one canvas, three classes, and keyboard / on-screen buttons. No
images, no sounds, no fetch. `connect-src 'none'` then costs it nothing.
Original `main.js` is not loaded: it registered a service worker and an
appcache, and it owns a single cannon.

## capabilities

| capability | why |
|---|---|
| `db` | Best generation in a `private` collection; cannons in a `read-write` one; the swarm in a `read-only` one the host writes. |
| `multiplayer` | The room. Invite is OS chrome — this app never draws that button. |

Needs nothing newer than the App Store itself, so `minBuild` is **947**.

## Extra cannons

Each player owns one row and only ever writes that row. The host simulates
the swarm and publishes it on `world`. A guest who shoots a body claims the
hit on their own row; the host applies it.

## Building

```bash
node apps/invaderz/vendor.mjs   # only when moving the upstream pin (needs net)
node apps/invaderz/build.mjs    # -> site/apps/invaderz/invaderz.gif
```

## Licence

MIT, Victor Ribeiro. The notice is packed **inside the GIF** as
`COPYING-invaderz.txt` as well as living here, because a copy of this app
that someone was handed is a distribution of that work.
