# Contrast Ratio

Check whether **text can be read** on a colour. Type two colours. The number in the circle is the contrast: **bigger is easier to read**.

## The loop

1. Put the **page colour** in **Background**.
2. Put the **word colour** in **Text**.
3. Read the circle and the line beside it.

You can type a name (`white`, `black`, `rebeccapurple`), a hex (`#333` or `333`), `rgb()`, `hsl()`, or `hsla()` with a see-through amount. The **swatch** at the left of each box shows the colour and opens a colour picker when you tap it.

Whatever you type, the **hex** is always on screen, at the right of that box's label: `rebeccapurple` reads `#663399`, `hsl(40, 90%, 60%)` reads `#f5b83d`. A see-through colour gets eight digits — `#000000b3` is black at 70%. That is the form to paste back into a stylesheet.

The **⇆** button between the two boxes flips the pair.

**Best** in either box fills that box with the colour that has the most contrast against the *other* one. The answer is always **black or white**: contrast only grows as two colours move apart, so the most there can ever be sits at one end of the scale. Which end wins is measured rather than guessed — on a mid grey it is black, by a whisker.

The panel below the verdict is painted in those two colours, at large size and at ordinary reading size, so you can *see* the answer as well as read it.

## What the circle means

The circle’s colour is the verdict, and the words beside it say the same thing:

- **Red — Fails.** Too close. Not readable at any size.
- **Amber — Large text only.** Good enough above 18pt, or bold above 14pt, and for icons and controls.
- **Yellow-green — Passes AA.** Ordinary text is fine at any size.
- **Green — Passes AAA.** The strict level, at any size.

The small grey line underneath is the detail: the exact ratio, then how light each colour is on its own (its luminance).

When a colour is **see-through**, there is no single answer — what sits underneath changes the result. The verdict then reads **Between 4.75 and 21**, the line beneath names every case it could be, and the circle splits into those colours.

## Private vs Invite

The last pair you typed comes back the next time you open the app.

This app has no shared board. **Invite** in the bar above the app shares the app itself, not the colours you typed.
