# Contrast Ratio

Check whether text can be read on a colour. Nothing is uploaded.

An unofficial port of **[contrast-ratio](https://github.com/siege-media/contrast-ratio)**
by siege-media (MIT), from the checker [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/) first
wrote. Same two colours, same circle, same WCAG number.

```
index.html              one column: the two colour fields, the verdict, the preview
style.css               the column, the swatches, the checkerboard under alpha
app.js                  parse colours, paint the verdict, Best pick, private last pair
icon.mjs                procedural split-card icon and the 1200×720 cover
build.mjs               packs the GIF into site/apps/contrast-ratio/contrast-ratio.gif
vendor/color.js         siege-media/contrast-ratio color.js, MIT, pinned
```

## Why this can run as a GifOS app

Upstream is a public website that never sends the colours. The GifOS port keeps
that: nothing is fetched. Tracking, GitHub buttons, the Siege Media advert, and
Incrementable (loaded from another host) are stripped. The last pair is stored
in a **private** collection.

The results panel is always on — a finger cannot hover the circle.

The layout is NOT upstream's. Upstream floats a control stage over two
fixed half-screen colour panels; in an app window that overlaps its own text,
wastes half the width on an empty panel, and pushes the verdict below the fold
on a phone. The port is one column instead — fields, verdict, preview — which
fits any window and needs no media query to re-architect itself.

## capabilities

| capability | why |
|---|---|
| `db` | Last pair in a `private` collection. |

Needs nothing newer than the App Store itself, so `minBuild` is **947**.

## Building

```bash
node apps/contrast-ratio/build.mjs   # -> site/apps/contrast-ratio/contrast-ratio.gif
```

Do not run `scripts/build-app-catalog.mjs` from this change — `index.json`
is owned elsewhere.
