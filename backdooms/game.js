/*
 * Backdooms — the simulation, as a classic script.
 * Logic descends from Kuber Mehta's THE-BACKDOOMS.html (MIT). The view is
 * render.js, the pictures are art.js, the GifOS shell is boot.js.
 *
 * One original frame is one step() at 16 ms, and draw() is optional, so a unit
 * test can play the whole loop with no canvas and no browser.
 *
 * Three things changed from upstream, and each one is here because the new
 * renderer made the old behaviour visible:
 *
 *   THE LEVEL. Upstream's world is `noise < 0.05 ? wall : floor` over a grid
 *   with two forced corridor lines — which is not a maze, it is an open plain
 *   with about fifteen pillars scattered across it. That is invisible when
 *   every surface is one flat colour, and glaring the moment walls have a
 *   baseboard: you almost never SEE a wall, so the texture never pays. It is
 *   now a lattice of one-wide halls with rooms, pillar halls, partitioned
 *   rooms and solid mass between them — the Backrooms' own floor plan, still
 *   infinite, still a pure function of (i, j, seed), and connected by
 *   construction because the lattice is never blocked.
 *
 *   COLLISION. `f(~~nx, ~~ny)` truncates toward zero, so at negative
 *   coordinates it tests the wrong cell and you walk through the wall — and
 *   it tested the player as a POINT, so you could push your eye inside a wall
 *   and see the level from within. Math.floor, a radius, and per-axis
 *   resolution so you slide along a wall instead of sticking to it.
 *
 *   THE GUN. It was a hitscan cone that fired through walls. It is a shotgun
 *   now: one true pellet down the crosshair and six spread, damage falling off
 *   with range, and every pellet checked against the level first. Shooting a
 *   thing through two rooms of solid mass was funny exactly once.
