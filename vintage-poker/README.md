# Vintage Poker

Texas Hold'em. Friends who open the invite take the empty seats. The host deals.

An unofficial port of
**[Vintage Poker](https://github.com/Pobermeier/vintage-poker)**
by Patrick Obermeier (MIT). Upstream is a MERN site: React, Node, Express,
Mongo, JWT, socket.io. **The server is gone.** The host's browser deals.
Cards are CSS glyphs.
