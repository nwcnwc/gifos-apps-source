// Anyroad — other cars.
//
// The roads were empty, which is the one thing no real road is. This puts cars
// on them, and the whole design is shaped by the fact that it must cost almost
// nothing: the world is already streaming geometry, decoding elevation PNGs and
// drawing a quarter of a million triangles on a phone.
//
// So there is NO pathfinding and no road graph. Each car is given a WAY — a
// polyline the tile builder already computed in world metres for the ribbon —
// and drives along it at what that class of road is for, in its own lane.
//
// It does not stop at the end of one, though. OSM splits a street into a way
// per block, and dropping a car whenever its way ran out meant traffic
// evaporating every couple of hundred metres in front of you, which reads as
// broken rather than as traffic. A junction IS two ways whose ends touch, so at
// the end of one a car looks for another within a few metres and takes it —
// junction behaviour without a junction table. Cars now last long enough to
// follow, and only leave when they are genuinely out of the world.
//
// Everything the player can actually check is real: they stay on the
// carriageway, keep to their side, slow for what is in front of them, turn at
// junctions, and never appear closer than seventy metres.
//
// Cost per car per frame: advance along a polyline, one terrain height sample,
// one distance check against the player. Thirty of those is not measurable
// against a single road tile's mesh build.
