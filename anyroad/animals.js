// Anyroad — the wildlife.
//
// The world you fetch is geometry: roads, buildings, water, a heightfield.
// Nothing in it MOVES, and a road with nothing living near it is a road you
// stop looking at. So the app grows its own traffic — animals scattered along
// whatever road you happen to be on, that graze, wander, panic when a car comes
// at them, and cost you a windscreen if you get it wrong.
//
// Three things shape this:
//
//  1. THEY ARE NOT A TRAP. An animal is only ever spawned well ahead of the car
//     and never on the carriageway itself: it walks INTO the road while you can
//     see it coming. A hazard you cannot avoid is not a hazard, it is a tax.
//  2. THEY ARE CHEAP. A handful alive at a time, plain circle collision, no
//     pathfinding and no per-frame allocation — this runs inside the same frame
//     budget as a streaming 3D world on a phone.
//  3. THEY BELONG TO THE PLACE. Spawning is anchored to the road index the car
//     is already querying, so animals appear where a driver would meet them
//     rather than in the middle of the sea.
//
// They are deliberately NOT published to multiplayer. Every peer would need the
// same herd in the same place, which means either an authority (there is none —
// see mp.js) or a shared seed plus lockstep simulation. What everyone WOULD see
// is a different animal in a different place, which is worse than each player
// having their own. Damage is yours; the road is shared.
