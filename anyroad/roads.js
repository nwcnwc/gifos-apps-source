// Geometry comes from OpenStreetMap through Overpass, one query per tile, and
// is turned into three meshes laid over the terrain. Three things drive the
// design here, all of them consequences of where the data comes from:
//
//  - Overpass is donated infrastructure with a per-IP budget. One query per
//    tile, cached hard, and never re-asked for a tile we already hold.
//  - The GifOS fetch bridge caps a response at 8 MB. A dense city tile with
//    every building can blow past that, so a tile that comes back too large is
//    retried WITHOUT buildings and remembered as dense — degraded, not broken.
//  - What gets persisted is the parsed geometry, not the JSON and not the mesh.
//    Meshes are rebuilt whenever the frame re-pins; the JSON is ten times the
//    size of what we keep. And the cache is capped, because a GifOS app's db
//    is baked into its GIF when you save it.

  // want to keep?") and because a rural tile and a city tile differ by more
  // than an order of magnitude.
  //
  // Worth being clear what this budget is NOT: it has nothing to do with what

  // What costs is RESIDENCY: MAX_TERRAIN_TILES/MAX_ROAD_TILES in app.js bound

  // `brand:wikidata` that is language-proof — and the parser threw all of it
  // away. What comes back is the one thing that reads from a moving car: the
  // COLOUR OF THE SIGN. A red-and-yellow fascia on the corner is recognisable
  // at a distance where lettering is still four unreadable pixels.
  //
  // Deliberately colours and NOT logos or wordmarks. Those are trademarks, and
  // reproducing them inside a game is a different question from colouring a
  // band; a sign board in a company's own colours is what a filmed street
  // looks like anyway.
  //
  // Keyed by brand:wikidata where there is one (it survives translation and
  // spelling), then by a normalised name.
  // Brand colours as HEX, because that is how a company publishes the one it
  // paints its building. Parsed to floats once at load.
  //
  // Keys are NORMALISED names (lowercase, punctuation stripped, a leading "the"
  // dropped), plus brand:wikidata Q-ids where I could verify them. A guessed
  // Q-id is worse than none: it silently paints one company's colour on
  // another's corner and nothing ever complains.
  //
  // Roughly the top ~120 signs a driver passes, weighted to North America and
  // then western Europe. This list is the whole feature — the shader just reads
  // it — so adding a brand is one line and needs no rebuild of anything else.

    // 1. The level was Math.min of the ground under EVERY vertex of the ring, and
    //    `out geom` returns whole ways — a river polygon is tens of kilometres
    //    long, so most of its vertices lie outside any terrain this app will ever
    //    load. groundAt() answers `lift` (zero) for those, Math.min took the zero,
    //    and the water was meshed at y=0.3 while the ground at Niagara is ~175 m.

    //    underneath the terrain and depth-tested away.
    // 2. Even with every tile loaded, ONE flat level per polygon cannot describe
    //    a river that falls fifty metres down a waterfall. The minimum is the
    //    gorge floor, so the whole upper river would be buried under its own bank.
    //
    // So the ring is CLIPPED TO THIS TILE first and levelled from what is under
    // that piece. Clipping is what makes per-tile levels legal: without it every
    // tile meshes the whole river and the copies sit at different heights,

  // The roof, as a RIDGE rather than a point. An apex over the centroid gives
  // every house a pyramid, and a street of pyramids is a street of tents — real
  // roofs run a ridge along the long axis and hip or gable at the ends. The
  // ridge is a segment through the centroid along the footprint's long axis;
  // collapse it to zero length and this is the old pyramid, which is still the
  // right answer for a square plan.
  // A pitched roof, hipped or gabled, over an arbitrary footprint.
  //
  // The first version of this laid the ridge along the NORTH/EAST bounding box
  // and fanned every eave up to whichever of the ridge's two ENDPOINTS was
  // nearer. Both parts are wrong for real buildings and together they are what
  // made so many house roofs lopsided and spiky:
  //
  //   1. OSM buildings are not axis-aligned. A house rotated 30 degrees has an
  //      AABB far larger than itself, so spanX/spanZ describe the box and not
  //      the house — the "long axis" could come out perpendicular to the actual
  //      ridge, and the ridge could run outside the footprint entirely.
  //   2. With only two possible apexes, adjacent edges could pick DIFFERENT
  //      endpoints in a non-contiguous order. Neighbouring triangles then rise
  //      to points metres apart and the surface tears — visible as the sharp
  //      angular creases, and as triangles crossing straight through each other.
  //
  // Now: the ridge runs along the footprint's OWN principal axis (2x2 PCA of
  // the corners, which is exact for the rectangles most houses are), and each
  // eave rises to the nearest point ON the ridge segment rather than to an end
  // of it. That is what a hip roof actually is — two long slopes meeting a
  // ridge line, two ends folding in to its tips — and because the apex now
  // varies continuously along the ridge, adjacent triangles share an edge
  // instead of arguing about it.
