//
// Nothing in the app hardcodes a URL. Every layer names a SOURCE, and a source
// is a small record: a URL template, how to read what comes back, and who to
// credit. Two reasons this is a registry and not three constants:
//
//  1. A GifOS app's requests all leave from the gifos.app origin, so every
//     player carries the same Referer. Distributed IPs do not help there: one
//     rule at a provider blocks every player at once. Being able to switch
//     source in-app means that is an inconvenience, not a dead app.
//  2. Imagery worth looking at is licensed. Rather than route everyone through
//     one endpoint under terms that do not cover it, the satellite drape runs
//     on the player's OWN key — their account, their quota, their terms.
//
// Adding a source whose host is not in manifest.json's capabilities.network
// will be refused by the runtime. That is the sandbox working as intended; the
// GifOS answer is to mod the GIF (its manifest travels with it) rather than to
// widen the allowlist for everyone.
