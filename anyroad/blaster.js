// Anyroad — the blaster.
//
// A gun on the roof, firing straight ahead. It is ON by default, and the reason
// it earns that is not spectacle: the wildlife is a hazard you are supposed to
// avoid, and until now the only two outcomes were avoiding it or paying for it.
// This is the third one. An animal that has been shot is off the road before
// you reach it, so the blaster is a way of DEALING with the hazard rather than
// a way of ignoring it — you still have to see the deer, and you still have to
// do something about it in time.
//
// Three decisions worth writing down:
//
//  1. PROJECTILES, NOT HITSCAN. A hitscan blaster is one line of code and no
//     fun: nothing crosses the gap, so there is no lead, no travel, and no
//     reason to fire early. A bolt at 180 m/s takes most of a second to reach
//     something at the edge of the fog, which is exactly the window in which
//     the decision is interesting.
//  2. IT STOPS AT WALLS. The bolt is tested against the same wall index the
//     car collides with, so it cannot shoot through a building — the world
//     already knows what is solid and a second answer would be a second
//     answer to disagree with.
//  3. TRAFFIC TAKES SEVERAL. One-shotting cars empties the road faster than it
//     refills, and an empty road is what traffic.js exists to prevent.
