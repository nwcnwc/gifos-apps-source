# IsoCity

A tiny isometric city. Tap a tile, put it down. No budget, no score.
**Sixteen tiles on a side** (the original is 7×7; an old save nests in the
middle). Drag to pan, pinch to zoom. Share the map from one invite. The
city is still there when you come back.

An unofficial port of **[IsoCity](https://github.com/victorqribeiro/isocity)**
by victorqribeiro (MIT). The pictures are Kenney's isometric landscape/city
tiles (CC0). Playing alone is that game, on a bigger map, with the city
saved in the file. Press **Share the map**, then **Invite**, and everyone
paints on the same city — the city you already built, not a blank. On a
phone, drag to pan, pinch to zoom, tap to place (the original was never
designed for a thumb). Press **Compare cities** and each of you keeps your
own, and you can peek.

## capabilities

| capability | why |
|---|---|
| `db` | Solo city (private) and the room’s shared map / compared cities (read-write). Needs nothing newer than the App Store itself, so `minBuild` is **947**. |
| `multiplayer` | The room. Invite is OS chrome — this app never draws its own share sheet. |

No `network`, no `wasm`. The original is plain JS and one PNG.

## The room

**Share the map.** Each player writes tile strokes on **their own row**. The
elected host (lowest present id) applies legal placements onto the `city` row.
Guests never write `city`. A stroke that is off the 16×16 grid or names a tile
that does not exist is dropped. A 7×7 city arriving from an older save is
nested in the middle before it is applied.

**Compare cities.** Each player publishes their own city on their own row.
Tap a name to look; you only ever edit yours.

## Building

```bash
node apps/isocity/vendor.mjs      # only when moving the isocity pin (needs net)
node apps/isocity/build.mjs       # -> site/apps/isocity/isocity.gif
```

Do not bump `GIFOS_VERSION`. The catalog refresh (`build-app-catalog.mjs`)
is a separate, signed step.

## Licence

IsoCity is MIT, Victor Ribeiro, 2019. The Kenney tile sheet is CC0. Both
notices are packed **inside the GIF** as `COPYING-isocity.txt` and
`COPYING-kenney.txt`.
