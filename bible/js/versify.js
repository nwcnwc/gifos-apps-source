/* Versification — one verse, three numbering traditions.
 *
 * Every pack declares header.versification: 'kjv', 'hebrew' or 'greek'. The
 * three disagree about where chapters and verses divide, so two packs shown
 * side by side drift apart unless the reference is mapped. Hebrew Joel runs to
 * four chapters where English merges three and four; Hebrew Malachi 3:19-24 is
 * English Malachi 4; the Greek Psalter joins Psalms 9 and 10 and so runs a
 * psalm behind from there on; and in a Hebrew or Greek psalter the
 * superscription is verse 1, which pushes the rest of the psalm up by one.
 *
 * The table is a list of RUNS: a run of verses on the Hebrew side and the run
 * it answers to on the other side. One row serves both directions — the
 * reverse lookup reads the same row backwards — so a mapping can never
 * disagree with its own inverse. A row whose two runs are the same length is
 * EXACT: whole verse for whole verse, and A -> B -> A returns what it started
 * with. A row that merges or splits, or that is marked NEAR, answers
 * exact:false — the right neighbourhood, a different division. Exact rows are
 * matched first, so the verse a superscription pushed aside never steals the
 * lookup from the verse that really answers to it.
 *
 * Every row was checked against the packs the catalog ships (the WLC packs for
 * Hebrew, eng-kjv/eng-asv/engbsb for English, eng-Brenton/latVUC/russyn for
 * Greek); test/unit/bible-versify.js maps every verse of a whole pack through
 * the table and asserts the answer exists in the target pack.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT MAPPED, because the tag does not record it:
 *
 *   Outside the Psalter the 'greek' tag says nothing about how a text divides
 *   its chapters. A pack is tagged greek because of its PSALTER, and the packs
 *   that carry that psalter split evenly: eng-Brenton and grclxx divide Joel,
 *   Malachi, Zechariah and Nahum the Hebrew way, while latVUC, engDRA and
 *   russyn divide them the English way. So a greek reference outside Psalms is
 *   returned unrenumbered, with exact:false wherever the Hebrew and English
 *   divisions differ. The same holds for the LXX's reordered Jeremiah, the
 *   Greek additions inside Daniel and Esther, and the 3 Kingdoms transposition
 *   of 1 Kings 20 and 21 — all listed in NEAR_GREEK.
 *
 *   New Testament verse divisions (3 John 14/15, 2 Corinthians 13:12-14,
 *   Acts 19:40-41, Revelation 12:18 / 13:1) are an EDITION difference —
 *   critical text against Textus Receptus — and the versification tag does not
 *   record it: grcsr prints 3 John 15 and grc-tisch prints 2 Corinthians 13:13
 *   while both are tagged kjv, exactly like eng-kjv, which prints neither. So
 *   EDITION rows only ever flag the neighbourhood; no NT reference is
 *   renumbered on a claim this module cannot check.
 *
 *   The deuterocanon is not mapped at all: Sirach, Tobit and Baruch divide
 *   differently between the Greek and Latin traditions, and neither the kjv
 *   nor the hebrew tradition prints them to compare against.
 *
 *   A tag is a fingerprint, not a promise: build-packs.mjs reads it off the
 *   text (Joel's fourth chapter, the joined Psalm 9), so a mixed edition wears
 *   a tag that is only true of part of it — deutkw chapters Joel the Hebrew way
 *   and numbers its psalms the English way. A table over references cannot see
 *   that, and a caller holding both packs can: an answer that will not address
 *   in the target pack is the pack's own division, not a row here.
