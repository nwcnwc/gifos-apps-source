# Offline Text to Speech

The first **Provider app** (see `docs/providers.md`): it doesn't do a job on
its own screen — it gives the OS an ability. Installed and assigned in
**Settings → AI models**, it serves the **Text → speech** AI role to every
app on the computer via `gifos.provider.serve({ tts: … })`, entirely
offline: no network capability, no key, nothing leaves the device.

## How it's put together

- **Everything rides in the GIF** (~1.6 MB deflated), Chess Grandmaster's
  pattern: `build.mjs` packs `vendor/espeak.js` (the eSpeak core compiled to
  JS, from meSpeak/speak.js, pre-wrapped to `window.__ESpeak`) as an
  executable `engine.js`, and the config + en-us voice as JS string modules
  (`engine-data.js` / `voice-data.js`). No eval, no wasm hatch — it's plain
  asm.js-era JavaScript the runtime inlines like any other app file. The
  install-time **assets** pattern is deliberately NOT used: at 5.6 MB raw
  the engine sits well under the 8 MB floor `build-app-catalog.mjs`
  enforces — that pattern is reserved for genuinely huge public model
  weights (docs/providers.md).
- `app.js` is a compact driver derived from meSpeak's raw-WAV path
  (VFS setup → argstack → `run()` → read `wav.wav`), with the known
  every-~80th-call FS hiccup handled by a rebuild-and-retry.
- OpenAI-style voice names (`nova`, `onyx`, `whisper`, …) map onto eSpeak
  variants, so consumer apps written against a cloud TTS work unchanged.
  `speed` accepts the OpenAI 0.25–4 multiplier; returns 22.05 kHz mono WAV
  as `{ bytes, mime: 'audio/wav' }`.

The vendored engine source lives in `vendor/` (the app's source tree, like
chess-grandmaster's `sf-src.js` + `stockfish.wasm`); the committed GIF under
`site/apps/offline-tts/` is the built artifact.

## Licensing

eSpeak and the meSpeak/speak.js build are **GPLv3** (see
`COPYING-espeak.txt`), so this app is GPLv3 — the same posture as
Chess Grandmaster bundling Stockfish. Source lives in this directory and in
the staged assets; the engine files carry their original notices.

## Rebuild

```bash
node apps/offline-tts/build.mjs        # packs the slim GIF into site/apps/offline-tts/
node scripts/build-app-catalog.mjs      # refresh the store catalog
```

Sign with the rest of the catalog: `node scripts/sign-apps.mjs` (`GIFOS_SIGN_KEY`, not GitHub).
