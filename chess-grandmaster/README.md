# Chess Grandmaster

Play **full-strength Stockfish** — the real engine, NNUE and all — running
entirely on your device, offline, inside the GifOS sandbox. Pick a level from
club player to the unshackled engine, and watch the live win / draw / loss
read-out as it thinks.

## What it is

A complete chess app in one GIF:

- **A real engine.** This bundles Stockfish 18 (the *lite single-threaded* WASM
  build), NNUE evaluation net embedded. Not a JavaScript reimplementation — the
  actual engine, compiled to WebAssembly.
- **Pick your level.** A strength ladder from ~1320 Elo (Beginner) up through
  Grandmaster (~2850), plus a top rung that removes the leash entirely
  (Skill Level 20, no Elo cap) — objectively stronger than any human alive.
- **Live probabilities.** With `UCI_ShowWDL` on, every search reports the
  engine's win / draw / loss odds; the app shows them from White's side, plus a
  centipawn evaluation and the best line it's found.
- **Hints, take-backs, resign, promotion picker.** A hint only ever appears
  when you press **Hint** — never on its own — and the whole coaching layer
  (eval bar, W/D/L, best line, Hint) toggles off for a distraction-free game.
- **Game history & replay.** Every finished game is saved into the icon; open
  **Game history** to see your results and step through any past game move by
  move. Your in-progress game also auto-saves, so you can close the tab and
  resume right where you left off.
- **Play a friend (multiplayer).** Press **Play a friend**, then **Invite**
  (top bar) to bring people in. Two players take the White/Black seats and
  everyone else waits in line; **winner stays**, loser goes to the back of the
  queue. Stockfish is *not* a player and gives no hints, but either seat can
  flip a shared **Commentary** toggle — after each move the engine reacts
  ("Nice move! 😎", "Ouch. 😬") for both players, colour commentary only, never
  the best move. Choose **"let a friend keep it going"** when you Invite so the
  game survives if the person who started it leaves. Games with guests are saved
  to history too.

## Why it needs `capabilities.wasm`

GifOS apps run in a locked-down sandbox: an opaque origin with
`connect-src 'none'` (no network) and no `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` — which means
WebAssembly is normally refused outright. A chess engine can't run there.

So this app declares the **`wasm`** capability. That relaxes the sandbox CSP by
exactly two things and nothing else:

- `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` in `script-src` — so a WebAssembly module can be
  instantiated at all.
- `worker-src blob:` — so heavy WASM engines can run on a Web Worker.

**`connect-src` stays `'none'`.** The engine gets *zero* network. Its `.wasm`
(with the NNUE net inside) is handed to it as bytes via `wasmBinary`, so nothing
is ever fetched. The engine can compute; it cannot phone home. When you open the
app, the abilities acknowledgement tells you plainly that it "runs a compiled
engine on your device."

This app runs the engine on the **main thread** (the build is compiled with
Asyncify, so `go` searches yield to the event loop and the board stays
responsive); the `worker-src` relaxation is part of the capability for engines
that prefer a worker.

## Building

```
node apps/chess-grandmaster/build.mjs
```

That packs the source below into the finished, self-contained
`site/apps/chess-grandmaster/chess-grandmaster.gif` (~8 MB — it carries the
whole engine). Two of the
packed files are generated from the vendored engine at build time:

- `sf-glue.js` — the Stockfish glue, made executable, with its self-init tail
  rewritten so the module factory lands on `window.SF_FACTORY`.
- `sf-wasm.js` — `window.GM_WASM_B64`, the `.wasm` as base64, handed to the
  engine as `wasmBinary`.
