"""Build the GifOS port's bundled starter voice + the parity fixture.

Runs INSIDE the sound-it-out desktop repo's venv (it imports gen/ for the
fixture and reads the starter voice from the repo's assets):

    cd ~/projects/sound-it-out && .venv/bin/python \
        ~/projects/gifos/apps/sound-it-out/tools/gen-clips.py

Outputs: ../clips-data.js               GENERATED but COMMITTED.
         ../dictionary-data.js          the aligned dictionary (0.6.0's
                                        assets/dictionary/aligned.txt),
                                        JSON-encoded for the sandbox.
         tools/curriculum-fixture.json  gen/levels.py's library builder over a
                                        canonical library, for
                                        test/unit/sound-it-out.js.

THE BUNDLE IS THE STARTER VOICE AND NOTHING ELSE - the app author's own
recordings, shipped so a buildup is never two voices. No synthesis: a Kokoro
word arriving after human phonemes is jarring enough to make the buildup not
worth doing (the author's words). Whatever exists under assets/starter-voice/
{phonemes,words,sentences} is transcoded and packed; today that is the 42
phoneme clips, and when the author records the pack words and sentences
upstream, rerunning this picks them up with no code change. The FAMILY's
recordings are never touched - they live only in their own device's app.
