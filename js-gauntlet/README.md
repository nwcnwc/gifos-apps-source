# Dungeon Party

Jake Gordon's HTML5 Gauntlet, as a sandboxed GifOS app. Solo it is the
original dungeon crawler. Send the invite and extra adventurers walk into
the same room — the original had no server.

The engine is
**[javascript-gauntlet](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-gauntlet)**
by Jake Gordon — MIT. Music and Premium Beat SFX were licensed only for
that project and are not shipped; the dungeon is silent. The arcade
wordmark and box-art splash are not shipped.

## capabilities

| capability | why |
|---|---|
| `db` | High score / level in `prefs` (private); pilots in `players` (read-write); host dungeon snapshot in `world` (read-only). |
| `multiplayer` | The room. Invite is OS chrome. |

`minBuild` is **947**.

## Extra adventurers

Each player writes only their own row (class + input). The host simulates
the map, including extra Player objects, and publishes a compact snapshot
on `world`. A guest paints that snapshot — including the other adventurers —
and sends thumbs. Unique classes first; a fifth friend watches.

## Building

```bash
node apps/js-gauntlet/vendor.mjs   # only when moving the pin
node apps/js-gauntlet/build.mjs
```

Do not run `scripts/build-app-catalog.mjs` from this tree.
