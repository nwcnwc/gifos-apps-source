# Tanks

Drive a tank. Invite is the arena. No Node, no socket.io.

An unofficial port of
**[Realtime Multiplayer in HTML5](https://github.com/ruby0x1/realtime-multiplayer-in-html5)**
by Sven Bergström (MIT). Upstream is the Build New Games demo: an
Express + socket.io tick and two rectangles. **The server is gone.**
The host's browser holds the room. Tanks have turrets. Phone sticks.
Invite is the arena.

```

sim.js             arena, tanks, shells, drones (DOM-free)
net.js             each player owns one row

## capabilities

| capability | why |
|---|---|
| `db` | `players` (read-write) and private `prefs` (career). |
| `multiplayer` | The invite is the arena. |

No `network`. `minBuild` is **947**.

Do not run `scripts/build-app-catalog.mjs` from this change.
