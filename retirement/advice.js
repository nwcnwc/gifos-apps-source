/* advice.js — turn the percentage into something to actually do.

 * Every calculator in this category ends the same way: a number, and the reader
 * left to work out what to change. The one tool that ends with an instruction
 * buries it below four graphs. So this file exists to answer the question a
 * percentage provokes — "fine, what do I do about it?" — and to answer it with
 * MEASURED numbers.
 *
 * The rule the whole file is built on: EVERY CLAIM IS SIMULATED, NEVER ASSERTED.
 * "Retire two years later" is only offered after retiring two years later has
 * been run against all of history and the new success rate read off. Nothing
 * here is a rule of thumb, and nothing here is rounded up in the flattering
 * direction. A suggestion that has not been measured is advice, and advice is
 * exactly what this app has no business giving.
