/* sim.js — the whole retirement engine. No DOM, no globals but RetireSim.
 *
 * EVERYTHING IN THIS FILE IS IN TODAY'S DOLLARS.
 *
 * That is not a display choice, it is the reason the arithmetic is simple.
 * MARKET.stock and MARKET.bond are Shiller's REAL total-return indices, so
 * inflation is already out of them. A salary of $80,000 and a spend of $60,000
 * are therefore the same numbers in year 1 and year 40 — no escalation, no
 * compounding two inflation series against each other, no "is this nominal?"
 * anywhere. The one thing that genuinely is nominal — a pension with no
 * cost-of-living adjustment — is handled by DIVIDING it down with CPI, which is
 * the honest direction and the one most calculators skip.
 *
 * A run is monthly. Two sleeves (stocks, bonds) grow on their own real series,
 * money moves at the START of the month, and the sleeves rebalance to target
 * once a year. Monthly matters: sequence-of-returns risk is the thing that
 * decides a retirement, and annual steps smooth away exactly the part that
 * hurts.

   * This is a quadratic through the published curve: about -1.4% a year at the
   * trough, rising either side of it, roughly +1.7% by 60 and +2.4% by 100. It
   * is an APPROXIMATION of a figure read off a chart, not a fitted coefficient
   * from the paper, and it is OFF by default — a plan that quietly assumes you
   * will want less as you age is flattering itself.
   *
   * Turning it on raises the safe rate materially, which is the point: the flat
   * assumption is the conservative one and most people's actual lives are not
   * flat.
