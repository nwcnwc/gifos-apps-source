// The Retirement Calculator's arithmetic, pinned against the published record.
//
// This app's whole claim is that its numbers are the real ones. That claim is
// only worth anything if it is CHECKED, and it cannot be checked by eye — a
// withdrawal engine that is 15% too optimistic looks exactly like one that is
// right until you put it beside a paper. So every number below comes from a
// published source, named in the comment above it, and the engine has to hit it.
//
// The four things most likely to silently break, and why each is here:
//
//   1. THE DATA. If Shiller's series is ever refreshed with price-only returns
//      instead of total return, every answer gets ~2/3 worse in the optimistic
//      direction and nothing throws. The long-run CAGRs catch it.
//   2. THE 4% RULE. It is the one number every reader can check. If the engine
//      drifts, this is where it shows.
//   3. THE WORST COHORT. The mid-1960s beat 1929 because stagflation hurts a
//      withdrawing portfolio more than a fast crash. Getting 1929 back would
//      mean the inflation handling had broken.
//   4. THE STRATEGIES. Each is a published rule with exact parameters, and each
//      was wrong here once already by being copied from a popularization rather
//      than the paper.
