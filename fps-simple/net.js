/*
 * FPS Simple — netplay transport.
 *
 * Upstream has NO networking of any kind: not one file in it mentions a socket,
 * a peer or a datachannel. It is you against a procedurally-spawned garrison.
 * Everything multiplayer about this app is here and in remote.js.
 *
 * WHAT GIFOS GIVES US, AND WHAT IT COSTS. The only channel an app has is the
 * replicated collection — gifos.db('players').subscribe(...) — hosted by the
 * host's browser. Two properties shape every decision below:
 *
 *   1. A subscriber re-downloads the WHOLE collection on every change, so
 *      traffic is O(players²). The answer is a LOW publish rate with client-side
 *      interpolation, not a high one, and rows kept mean (coordinates rounded to
 *      the centimetre — a shooter cannot tell, and it is a third of the bytes).
 *   2. There is no datagram path and no server tick. So this cannot be, and does
 *      not pretend to be, competitive-grade netcode.
 *
 * NOBODY WRITES TO ANYBODY ELSE'S ROW. Each player owns exactly one record and
 * only ever reads the others — anyroad's rule, and it is what lets this work with
 * no authority to arbitrate. That decides how damage flows:
 *
 *   - The SHOOTER decides what it hit, locally, against the bodies it can see —
 *     "favour the shooter", the same call every net FPS makes, and the only one
 *     that feels right when the wire is 6 Hz. Claims ride on the shooter's own
 *     row as a short ring of recent shots.
 *   - The TARGET decides what that costs it. It applies the damage to itself,
 *     decides its own death, and publishes its own health. A client that ignored
 *     incoming hits would be cheating, and it would be cheating in a game you
 *     reach by sending someone a link — the threat model is friends, so the
 *     honest design is the simple one, said plainly in the README.
 *
 * A claim is deduped on (shooter id, sequence), because a row is re-delivered
 * on every unrelated change and a hit must land exactly once.
