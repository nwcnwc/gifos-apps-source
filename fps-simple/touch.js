/*
 * FPS Simple — touch controls.
 *
 * Upstream has NO touch input at all: keyboard, pointer-locked mouse, gamepad.
 * On a phone it renders perfectly and you cannot move or aim. Since most people
 * open GifOS on a phone, that is not a footnote, it is the app being broken.
 *
 * This adds a real thumb layout WITHOUT forking upstream, by writing into the
 * two channels its Input class already exposes to a gamepad:
 *
 *   input.stick.moveX / moveY   the left stick — already folded into moveVector()
 *   input._rawLook.x / .y       accumulated look delta, scaled by sensitivity
 *                               in beginFrame() exactly like mouse movement
 *   input._pendingDown / Up     the key/button edge queues, keyed by code
 *
 * So a thumb on glass arrives as the same numbers a gamepad or a mouse would
 * produce, and nothing downstream — movement, weapons, the HUD — needs to know
 * the difference. Even sprint is free: upstream sprints when the stick is pushed
 * past 0.92, so pushing the pad to its edge sprints, with no button for it.
 *
 * ONE DELIBERATE ASYMMETRY. Movement is a STICK (rate: hold a direction, keep
 * walking) but look is a DRAG (delta: move your thumb, the view moves that far
 * and stops). That is how every phone shooter worth playing does it, and it is
 * why look writes _rawLook rather than stick.lookX — the stick channel is a
 * turn RATE, which feels like stirring soup when your thumb is on glass.
 *
 * Shown only after a real touchstart. A laptop with a touchscreen reports
 * ontouchstart and must not get a phone HUD laid over its game.

  // reached the pad — right target, capture intact — and every one carried
  // clientX/clientY frozen at the same impossible point (0,-31), 688 px and
  // ten radii from a pad the thumb was demonstrably on. Chrome had granted
  // POINTER LOCK to the canvas, on a phone: boot asks for it on Play (the
  // right call on a desktop), and upstream's Input re-asks on every mousedown
  // — which a bare tap on the canvas synthesises. While the lock is held,
  // Chrome keeps delivering touch-derived pointer events to the right element
  // but freezes their client coordinates, and an absolute-position stick has
  // nothing left to steer by. The buttons kept working through it because a
  // button reads no coordinates, and the pause menu revived the stick because
  // pausing calls document.exitPointerLock() — which is exactly how it was
  // reported: "the joystick works when I have the Pause menu pulled up".
  //
  // So once a real finger has proven this is a touch screen, the lock is
  // banned: requests are swallowed at the one door every caller uses
  // (input.requestPointerLock — boot's Play handler, the pause menu's Resume,
  // and upstream's own mousedown all go through it), and a lock that slipped
  // in anyway — granted before the first touchstart, or by a future caller
  // with its own path — is exited the moment it appears. A mouse-only machine
  // never sets `active` and keeps pointer lock exactly as upstream intends.

  // THE PAD IS MEASURED EVERY SAMPLE, AND A SAMPLE THAT CANNOT BE A THUMB IS
  // DROPPED. Both halves are the same bug, measured on a Moto g24: the stick
  // walked north-west and only north-west, whichever way the thumb was dragged.
  //
  // The deflection is an ABSOLUTE position — where the finger is, against where
  // the pad is — so it is only ever as good as the agreement between those two
  // numbers, and the app spends its first second pulling them apart. Play asks
  // for fullscreen and locks the screen to landscape on the same gesture that
  // starts the game (boot.js goFullscreenLandscape), so the pad travels through
  // four layouts — top 581 -> 705 -> 195 -> 251 — while a thumb is already down
  // on it. A centre cached at pointerdown is stale by hundreds of pixels within
  // one frame of the press, and stale by far more than the pad is wide, so the
  // error swamps the thumb's own 68 px of throw and the vector stops depending
  // on the thumb at all. Reading the element per sample costs one rect on a
  // control that is one element, and cannot go stale.
  //
  // The second half is worse and is a browser bug: across that same transition
  // Chrome delivers pointermoves for the touch that is ALREADY DOWN with client,
  // page AND screen all exactly (0,0) — a position it does not have — before
  // following up with pointercancel. Measured, verbatim, off the phone:
  //
  //   pointerdown  client=[86.3, 649.7]  screen=[86.3, 781.7]   <- the real thumb
  //   pointermove  client=[0, -32]       screen=[0, 0]          <- no position
  //   pointermove  client=[0, 0]         screen=[0, 0]
  //   pointercancel
  //
  // Read as a thumb, the viewport's origin is up and to the left of a pad
  // anchored bottom-left, so every one of those samples resolves to the same
  // full-throw vector, (-0.13, -0.99): north-west, at a sprint, until the
  // player lifts. The finger is not at the top-left pixel of the phone — it is
  // 650 px away from a control 137 px across, which is nine pad-radii and not a
  // hand. Three radii is already well outside anything a thumb does to this pad
  // (the suite's own hardest over-drag, out to the sprint threshold, is 2.2),
  // so beyond that we keep the last deflection and wait for a sample that says
  // where the thumb really is. Holding is deliberate: a hiccup should cost the
  // player a moment of stiffness, never a direction they did not ask for.
