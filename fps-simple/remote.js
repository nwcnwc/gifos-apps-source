/*
 * FPS Simple — remote players as bodies in the world.
 *
 * The trick that makes multiplayer cheap here: upstream already has skinned,
 * animated, SHOOTABLE soldiers — the AI garrison. A remote player is one of
 * those bodies with its brain taken out and its transform fed from the wire.
 *
 * Everything then falls out for free, and it is worth being precise about what
 * "free" means, because it is the whole reason this app is a few hundred lines
 * rather than a few thousand:
 *
 *   - HIT DETECTION. Agents carry hit capsules that are pushed onto the animated
 *     skeleton every frame (Agent.syncHitboxes). The ballistics system already
 *     raycasts bullets against them with penetration, drop and travel time, and
 *     already emits `damage:dealt` naming the agent it hit. So aiming at another
 *     player uses the same code as aiming at the garrison — including headshots.
 *   - FEEDBACK. The HUD's hitmarkers listen to that same event, so a hit on a
 *     person reads exactly like a hit on a bot.
 *
 * WHAT WE MUST TAKE AWAY. An agent left to itself would think, path, and SHOOT
 * BACK — a remote player's body would open fire on its own initiative. So a net
 * body is marked `staged` (upstream's own "posed, not thinking" flag) with
 * `noDamage`, and the staged path is redirected here, where it does exactly two
 * things: put the body where the wire says, and animate it.
 *
 * Local health on a net body is also neutralised. The BODY is a puppet; the
 * PERSON's health lives in their own browser (see net.js). If we let the puppet
 * die locally we would show a corpse to a player who never accepted the hit —
 * so the puppet dies when, and only when, its owner says it died.
