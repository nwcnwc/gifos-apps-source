  // in and out of working"), forced a landscape fullscreen nobody asked for,
  // and laid the thumb HUD over a desktop. Reported on a touchscreen
  // Chromebook, 2026-08-17.

  //
  //   * `maxTouchPoints > 0` alone — what shipped — is true of every

  //     recorded at the Play handler below: the media query is something
  //     browsers answer for LAYOUT, and it matched in a headless desktop
  //     context, which is not a statement about the hardware.
  //
  // So require the hardware AND the intent: a touch digitiser exists, and the
  // primary pointer really is coarse. That is exactly "the person is pointing
  // with a thumb", and it is right in all four corners — phone (true), a
  // touchscreen laptop (false: fine primary), the headless desktop that fooled
  // the media query (false: no digitiser), plain desktop (false).
  //
  // A hybrid therefore gets the DESKTOP contract — lock the pointer, leave the
  // window alone — and loses nothing: touch.js reveals the thumb controls on
  // the first real touchstart and sheds the lock in the same breath, so a

  // on both of the devices that matter most, in opposite directions.
  //
  // The old picker read navigator.hardwareConcurrency and whether the pointer
  // was coarse. Neither of those is a GPU. A ChromeOS Linux container has no
  // /dev/dri at all, so every pixel is SwiftShader on the CPU — but it reports
  // 4 cores and a mouse, so it was handed 'medium': 280 SECONDS to reach the
  // Play button (205 s of it building the world) and then 0.9 fps, which is
  // 2.2 seconds a frame. A Moto g24 reports EIGHT cores and a touchscreen, so
  // it was handed 'medium' too, on a Mali-G52 MC2.
  //
  // So ask the device instead, in about 150 ms, before a single building
  // exists. Two questions: what the driver CALLS itself — decisive when the
  // answer is a software rasteriser, because no amount of CPU makes one
  // playable — and then what it actually DOES, timed, because a driver string
  // is a name and not a speed. The gap is not subtle: SwiftShader measures
  // 0.011 against the Mali's 1.02, a hundredfold, so this cannot confuse them.
  //
  // The measurement is adaptive, so it costs about the same on a workstation as
  // on a phone: one pass, then double until the batch is long enough to time
  // honestly, stopping early when it already is.

  //   * On this phone over CDP, Playwright's synthesized MOUSE click hangs

  //     sessions; adb-injected taps failed the same way). Every suite that
  //     needed the game running had to reach around the button entirely.
  //   * A press that only exists as a mouse click is also the least accessible
  //     shape available: no keyboard route at all.
  // So the press is now its own function with three doors onto it, all guarded
  // by `starting` so extra ones are free:
  //   1. click      — a mouse, a finger, or a trusted synthetic click.
  //   2. pointerup  — the touch/pointer path, which lands on devices where the
  //                   synthesized mouse click does not.
  //   3. Enter/Space — anywhere on the gate, not only when the button holds
  //                   focus. A keyboard is something every automation tool can

    // ONE GESTURE, TWO HATCHES THAT BOTH EAT IT — so the device decides which

    // the phone in a portrait strip (measured: refused, "Permissions check
    // failed"), and asking for fullscreen first broke pointer lock on the
    // desktop (measured: e2e-fps-simple's "the app locks the pointer" went red
    // the moment I swapped them).
    //
    // They are not equally valuable on both devices, which is what breaks the
    // tie. A touchscreen has no pointer to lock and is unplayable in a portrait
    // strip; a mouse has no orientation to hold and is useless without the lock.
    // So each device asks for the one it cannot do without, and the other is
    // picked up by armFullscreenRetry() on the very next tap or click.
    // THE POINTER ALWAYS, THE SCREEN ONLY WHERE IT IS THE POINT.
    //
    // Both want transient user activation and the first one spends it, so they
    // cannot both be asked for unconditionally. They are also wanted on
    // different machines, which is the way out: a mouse needs the lock and has
    // nothing to gain from fullscreen (F11 is right there), while a touchscreen
    // has no pointer to lock and is unplayable in a portrait strip.
    //
    // maxTouchPoints, not `(pointer: coarse)` ALONE: the media query is
    // something browsers answer for layout and it matched in a headless desktop
    // context, which is not a statement about the hardware. That lesson stands
    // and is why IS_TOUCH still requires a digitiser — but maxTouchPoints alone
    // was ALSO wrong, on every touchscreen laptop, so IS_TOUCH now demands both
    // (see its definition at the top). (I also briefly recorded
    // here that entering fullscreen RELEASES the lock — that was wrong. The red
    // lock assertion those runs were chasing turned out to be a stale app
    // catalog breaking the desktop mount entirely, and it is green with this
    // gating and with the catalog regenerated.)
    // A TOUCHSCREEN IS NOT ASKED FOR THE POINTER AT ALL. touch.js bans the lock
    // on touch devices anyway (Chrome on Android FREEZES touch coordinates while
    // one is held, which is what killed the movement stick), but asking and then
    // shedding is not free: the engine treats a lock it was holding disappearing
    // as Escape, and the game arrives PAUSED. Cheaper and quieter never to ask.
    // EVERY HATCH THAT NEEDS THE GESTURE IS OPENED BEFORE ANYTHING BLOCKS.
    // These used to sit AFTER engine.start(), and transient user activation
    // lasts about five seconds — so on any device where starting the engine
    // takes longer than that, the activation was already spent by the time we
    // asked. Measured on a Moto g24 (2026-08-17): a genuinely trusted tap,
    // `__FPS_FS__.trusted === true`, and fullscreen still came back

  // Play?", which is a different question and is false for ordinary reasons:
  // the pause menu releases the pointer (that is what pausing IS), so does
  // switching window, so does taking a screenshot. It told a player whose
  // pointer worked perfectly to go and turn on a permission they already had,
  // over a game that was merely paused.
  //
  // The honest test is whether a lock was EVER obtained. If it was, the
  // capability is present and nothing here is anybody's problem.
