# Matter Sandbox — gauntlet

**Win:** The Matter.js demo is a page you visit; this is a pile you keep in a GIF and share as a room.

Bar ONE: the matter.js demo (slingshot / mixed shapes / ragdoll) and Algodoo.
Bar TWO: the scene lives in the GIF; invite is a shared world; works offline.

## Round 1 — product

Arena first-boot matches the official slingshot silhouette (posts, rock, two pyramids, a ledge). Tools: Grab, Box, Ball, Ragdoll, Sling, Stack, Pause, Reset, gravity −2…2. Scene auto-saves into the file. Invite: host simulates, guests drop/grab/sling on their own row.

## Round 2 — icon / cover / listing

- Icon: a coloured pyramid knocked over by a rock. Reads at 64px; the loop is the app.
- Cover: a real stepped world — ragdoll flopped, rock in flight at the stack, sling selected, two in the room.
- Listing leads with the file-is-the-save and the shared room, not a feature list.

## Round 3 — the pile lives in the GIF

**Gap closed:** dropped boxes survive close. `persist()` no longer retriggers its 800 ms debounce on every dirty frame, so the write actually fires; pagehide / visibilitychange flush immediately. Reopen body count includes the extras.

## Remaining gap

Guest hands wait on the host’s next pose (~100 ms). Fine for a toy; not Algodoo’s local feel on a laggy link. No gears/fluids — this is the rigid-body toy box, not a CAD lab. Catalog index is owned elsewhere.
